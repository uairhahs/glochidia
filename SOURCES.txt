## Build Instructions

All binaries are compiled statically (unless functionality is tested on target) from the above sources using the build scripts in this repository:
- Alpine Linux (musl libc) for C/C++ programs: See container-build.sh

The complete build process is automated in grow_glochidium.sh and can be reproduced using:
```bash
REPO_URL=<source_url> BINARY_NAME=<tool_name> ./grow_glochidium.sh
```
